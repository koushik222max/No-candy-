🎂 Birthday Candy Rules – Python Style
✨ Why this is fun

Because birthdays are great… unless you’re person #3. Then it’s “no candy for you!” 😄

📜 What it does

Loops through 10 friends (or “persons”).

In the first loop: gives candy to everyone except person #3.

In the second loop: same rule, just written differently (== vs. !=).

A playful way to learn conditional statements in Python.

🖥 Example Output
hey person 1 today is my birthday
hey person 2 today is my birthday
hey person 3 no candy for you
...
hey fiend 3 no candy for you

🚀 Try it yourself

Clone the repo, run the file, and see who gets candy and who gets left out.
